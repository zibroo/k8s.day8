# Install External-dns into your Kubernetes cluster using HELM.
# Create a new DNS zone on a public DNS provider such as AWS Route53 or Google Cloud DNS. 
# Configure External-dns to use the DNS provider and the new zone. 
# Create a Service resource in your cluster and annotate it with a DNS hostname that matches the new zone. 
# Verify that External-dns has created a new DNS record for the Service in the public DNS provider.
